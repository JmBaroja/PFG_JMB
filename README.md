# “ANALYSIS OF DATA RELATED TO DDOS CYBERATTACKS THROUGH WEB SCRAPING OF A MAP IN REAL TIME”
Here is my final degree project about DDoS cyberattacks. You can find the instructions to it execution and usage here:

To begin with, Python must be installed on the machine so that it can be
run the program correctly. You must download the version chosen for this work (3.9.0),
which can be found at this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

In addition, we would need to have MySQL installed to be able to create
the database. In this case, version 8.0 of this software has been used. 
It can be downloaded for free at the following Oracle link: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/

When the MySQL Workbench software is ready, we can access, through the
client-server connection that this provides, to MySQL Server. Once accessed
server, a user must be created locally, assigning it within the program a
port, in my case I have used 3306, and with the following credentials (for your
later access from the application created):
• User: root
• Password: root

After having everything configured, we proceed to open the executable .exe file called "PFG_JMB" found at
dist folder. It is recommended, before its execution, create a new folder and move it inside,
due to the generation of files carried out by the program.
